    <h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to the world of code! Last year, millions of learners from our community started with HTML. Why? HTML is 
        the skeleton of all web pages. It’s often the first language learned by developers, marketers, and designers and
        is core to front-end development work. If this is your first time touching code, we’re excited for what you’re a
        bout to create.
        So what exactly is HTML? HTML provides structure to the content appearing on a website, such as images, text, or
        videos. Right-click on any page on the internet, choose “Inspect,” and you’ll see HTML in a panel of your screen.
        HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language:
        A markup language is a computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text.
        In HTML, the computer can interpret raw text that is wrapped in HTML elements.
        HyperText is text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through links, also known a
        s hyperlinks. You probably clicked on a couple of hyperlinks on your way to this Codecademy course.
        Learning HTML is the first step in creating websites, but even a bit of knowledge can help you inject code snippet
        s into newsletter, blog or website templates. As you continue learning, you can layer HTML with CSS and JavaScript 
        to create visually compelling and dynamic websites. But for now, we’re going to focus on how to add and modify bas
        ic content on a page, like text, images, and videos. Don’t worry if the websites look ugly — we’re just getting
        started.
        HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.

    <h1>Introduction To CSS</h1>
    <p>
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, governing the presentation and st
        yling of HTML elements on web pages. Originally proposed by Håkon Wium Lie and Bert Bos in 1994, CSS emerged as a
        solution to the limitations of HTML in terms of layout and design control. Since then, CSS has evolved into a po
        werful styling language, offering developers fine-grained control over the appearance of web content.
        At its core, CSS operates on a simple principle: selectors target HTML elements, and declarations define how thos
        e elements should be styled. CSS rules consist of selectors, properties, and values, with selectors identifying t
        he elements to style and declarations specifying the desired presentation. This separation of content (HTML) and 
        presentation (CSS) enables developers to create flexible, maintainable designs and adapt them easily to different
        devices and screen sizes.
        CSS offers a wide range of properties and values for controlling various aspects of element styling, including co
        lors, fonts, spacing, borders, backgrounds, and more. With properties like color, font-size, margin, padding, bor
        der, and background, developers can customize virtually every visual aspect of their web pages, from text and typ
        ography to layout and aesthetics.
        Selectors in CSS allow developers to target specific HTML elements, classes, IDs, attributes, or even structural 
        patterns within the document tree. Simple selectors like element names (div, p, a) and class names (.classname) a
        re commonly used, but CSS also supports more complex selectors such as combinators (descendant, child, sibling), 
        pseudo-classes (:hover, :focus, :nth-child()), and pseudo-elements (::before, ::after) for advanced styling and d
        ynamic effects.
        CSS is not only about static styling but also about creating responsive and interactive user interfaces. Media qu
        eries enable developers to apply different styles based on device characteristics like screen width, height, orie
        ntation, and resolution, allowing for the creation of responsive designs that adapt to various viewport sizes.
        Furthermore, CSS3 introduced a plethora of advanced features and modules, including animations, transitions, flex
        box, grid layout, variables (custom properties), filters, and blend modes. These features empower developers to c
        reate sophisticated layouts, animations, and visual effects without relying on JavaScript or third-party librarie
        s, enhancing the user experience and visual appeal of web applications.
        Despite its power and flexibility, CSS development can be challenging, particularly when dealing with browser com
        patibility issues and the intricacies of CSS specificity and inheritance. Cross-browser testing is essential to e
        nsure consistent rendering across different browsers and devices, while tools like preprocessors (e.g., Sass, Les
        s) and postprocessors (e.g., Autoprefixer) help streamline development and maintainability.
        In conclusion, CSS is an indispensable tool for web developers, enabling them to transform HTML content into visu
        ally appealing and interactive experiences. From basic styling to advanced layouts and animations, CSS empowers d
        evelopers to unleash their creativity and craft engaging user interfaces that delight users and enhance the overa
        ll web browsing experience. As the web continues to evolve, CSS will remain a fundamental technology driving inno
        vation and pushing the boundaries of web design and development.

    <h1>Introduction To JavaScript</h1>
    <p>
        JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for front-end web development, though 
        it's increasingly popular for server-side development as well, thanks to platforms like Node.js. Developed in the 
        mid-1990s by Brendan Eich at Netscape, JavaScript was originally named LiveScript but was renamed to align with J
        ava's popularity at the time. Despite its name, JavaScript shares little resemblance with Java.

        As a versatile language, JavaScript allows developers to create dynamic, interactive web pages by manipulating HT
        ML and CSS, handling browser events, and interacting with the Document Object Model (DOM). It's often used to add 
        functionality such as form validation, dynamic content updates, and interactive features like sliders, accordions,
        and carousels to websites.

        JavaScript is an essential component of modern web development stacks, working alongside HTML and CSS to create e
        ngaging user experiences. With the rise of single-page applications (SPAs) and front-end frameworks like React, An
        gular, and Vue.js, JavaScript has become even more crucial, enabling developers to build complex, responsive web a
        pplications with ease.

        One of JavaScript's key features is its asynchronous programming model, facilitated by features like callbacks, p
        romises, and async/await syntax. This allows developers to write non-blocking code, improving performance by ensuri
        ng that expensive operations like network requests don't block the main execution thread.

        JavaScript's ecosystem is vast and continuously evolving, with a plethora of libraries and frameworks available t
        o streamline development. From jQuery for DOM manipulation to Express.js for building server-side applications, dev
        elopers have access to a rich set of tools and resources to tackle a wide range of tasks.

        Moreover, JavaScript has expanded beyond the web browser with the advent of Node.js, a server-side JavaScript run
        time environment. Node.js allows developers to build scalable, high-performance web servers and applications using 
        JavaScript, leveraging its non-blocking I/O model to handle thousands of concurrent connections efficiently.

        Despite its widespread adoption and versatility, JavaScript isn't without its challenges. Its dynamic typing and 
        loose syntax can lead to bugs and runtime errors if not managed carefully. Additionally, browser inconsistencies an
        d compatibility issues across different versions can complicate development and testing efforts.

        Nevertheless, JavaScript remains an indispensable tool for web developers worldwide, driving innovation and power
        ing the dynamic, interactive experiences we've come to expect from modern websites and applications. As technology co
        ntinues to evolve, JavaScript will undoubtedly play a central role in shaping the future of web development.
